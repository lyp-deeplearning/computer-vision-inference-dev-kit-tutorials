# Introduction

Welcome to Face Detection Tutorial Step 3.  Now that the application can detect faces in images, we now want the application to estimate the age and gender for each face. The precompiled "age-gender-recognition-retail-0013" model included with the OpenVINO™ toolkit that we will be running was trained on approximately 20,000 faces. When it sees a face within 45 degrees (left, right, above, or below) of straight-on, it is 96.6% accurate on determining gender. It can also determine ages to within 6 years, on average. A sample output showing the results where the ROI box is now labeled “[M|F],<age>” appears below.  The metrics reported now also include the time to run the age and gender model.

# Age and Gender Detection Model

The OpenVINO™ toolkit provides a pre-compiled model for estimating age and gender from an image of a face. You can find it at:

* /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/intel_models/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013

    * Available model locations:

        * FP16: /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/intel_models/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013/FP16/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013.xml

        * FP32: /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/intel_models/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013/FP32/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013.xml

    * More details can be found at:

        * file:///opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/intel_models/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013/description/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013.html

The results it is capable of producing are shown in the summary below (for more details, see the descriptions HTML pages for each model):

# Adding the Age and Gender Detection Model

Thanks to the setup work done in Tutorial Step 2, adding the age and gender detection model in this step will just be a matter of deriving a new class from the BaseDetection class, adding an additional command line argument to specify the new model, and updating the application to run and track the statistics for the new model.  This means there will not be as much code to walk through this time.  That will let us focus on how to pass the important image inference results from the face detection model to the age and gender detection model.

1. Open up a terminal (such as Xterm) or use an existing terminal to get to a command shell prompt.

2. Change to the directory containing Tutorial Step 3:

```bash
cd tutorials/face_detection_tutorial/step_3
```


3. Open the files "main.cpp" and “face_detection.hpp” in the editor of your choice such as ‘gedit’, ‘gvim’, or ‘vim’.

## AgeGenderDetection

1. The AgeGenderDetection class is derived from BaseDetection and the member variables it uses are declared.

```cpp
struct AgeGenderDetection : BaseDetection {
    std::string input;
    std::string outputAge;
    std::string outputGender;
    int enquedFaces = 0;
```


2. The Result class is used to store the information that the model returns, specifically, the age of the face and the probability that it is a male or female face.

```Cpp
    struct Result { float age; float maleProb;};
```


3. The operator[] function is defined to give a convenient way to retrieve the age and gender results from the data contained in the inference request’s output blob. The index to the appropriate locations in the blob are calculated for the batch item. A result object is returned containing the data read for the batch index.

```cpp
    Result operator[] (int idx) const {
        auto  genderBlob = request->GetBlob(outputGender);
        auto  ageBlob    = request->GetBlob(outputAge);

        return {ageBlob->buffer().as<float*>()[idx] * 100,
                genderBlob->buffer().as<float*>()[idx * 2 + 1]};
    }
```

### AgeGenderDetection()

On construction of a AgeGenderDetection object, the base class constructor is called passing in the model to load specified in the command line argument FLAGS_m_ag, the name to be used when we printing out informational messages, and set the batch size to the command line argument FLAFS_n_ag. This initializes the BaseDetection subclass specifically for AgeGenderDetection.

```cpp
    AgeGenderDetection() : BaseDetection(FLAGS_m_ag, "Age Gender", FLAGS_n_ag) {}
```

### submitRequest()

The submitRequest() function is overridden to make sure that there are faces queued up to be processed before calling the base class submitRequest() function to start inferring vehicle attributes from the enqueued faces. enquedFaces is reset to 0 to indicate that all the queued data has been submitted.

```cpp
    void submitRequest() override {
        if (!enquedFaces) return;
        BaseDetection::submitRequest();
        enquedFaces = 0;
    }
```

### enqueue()

A check is made to see that the age and gender detection model is enabled.  A check is also made to make sure that the number of inputs does not exceed the batch size.  

```cpp
    void enqueue(const cv::Mat &face) {
        if (!enabled()) {
            return;
        }
        if (enquedFaces == maxBatch) {
            slog::warn << "Number of detected faces more than maximum(" << maxBatch << ") processed by Age Gender detector" << slog::endl;
            return;
        }
```

An inference request object is created if one has not been already been created. The request object is used for holding input and output data, starting inference, and waiting for completion and results.

```cpp
        if (!request) {
            request = net.CreateInferRequestPtr();
        }
```

The input blob from the request is retrieved and then matU8ToBlob() is used to copy the image image data into the blob.

```cpp
        auto  inputBlob = request->GetBlob(input);

        if (matU8ToBlob<float>(face, inputBlob, 1.0f, enquedFaces)) {
        	enquedFaces++;
        }
    }
```

### read()

The next function we will walkthrough is the AgeGenderDetection::read() function which must be specialized specifically to the model that it will load and run. 

1. The Inference Engine API InferenceEngine::CNNNetReader object is used to load the model IR files.  This comes from the XML file that is specified on the command line using the "-m_ag" parameter.  

```cpp
    CNNNetwork read() override {
        slog::info << "Loading network files for AgeGender" << slog::endl;
        InferenceEngine::CNNNetReader netReader;
        /** Read network model **/
        netReader.ReadNetwork(FLAGS_m_ag);
```

2. The maximum batch size is set to maxBatch (set using FLAGS_n_ag which defaults to 16).

```cpp
        /** Set batch size to 16 **/
        netReader.getNetwork().setBatchSize(maxBatch);
        slog::info << "Batch size is set to " << netReader.getNetwork().getBatchSize() << " for Age Gender" << slog::endl;
```

3. The IR .bin file of the model is read.

```cpp
        /** Extract model name and load it's weights **/
        std::string binFileName = fileNameNoExt(FLAGS_m_ag) + ".bin";
        netReader.ReadWeights(binFileName);
```

4. The proper number of inputs is checked to make sure that the loaded model has only one input as expected.

```cpp
        slog::info << "Checking Age Gender inputs" << slog::endl;
        InferenceEngine::InputsDataMap inputInfo(netReader.getNetwork().getInputsInfo());
        if (inputInfo.size() != 1) {
            throw std::logic_error("Age gender topology should have only one input");
        }
```

5. The input data format is prepared by configuring it for the proper precision (FP32 = 32-bit floating point) and memory layout (NCHW) for the model.

```cpp
        auto& inputInfoFirst = inputInfo.begin()->second;
        inputInfoFirst->setPrecision(Precision::FP32);
        inputInfoFirst->getInputData()->setLayout(Layout::NCHW);
        input = inputInfo.begin()->first;
```

6. The model is verified to have the two output layers as expected for the age and gender results. Variables are created and initialized to hold the output names to receive the results from the model.

```cpp
        slog::info << "Checking Age Gender outputs" << slog::endl;
        InferenceEngine::OutputsDataMap outputInfo(netReader.getNetwork().getOutputsInfo());
        if (outputInfo.size() != 2) {
            throw std::logic_error("Age Gender network should have two output layers");
        }
        auto it = outputInfo.begin();
        auto ageOutput = (it++)->second;
        auto genderOutput = (it++)->second;
```

7. A check is made to make sure that the model has the output layer types expected and output layers are swapped as necessary for receiving the age and the gender results.

```cpp
        // if gender output is convolution, it can be swapped with age
        if (genderOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->type == "Convolution") {
            std::swap(ageOutput, genderOutput);
        }

        if (ageOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->type != "Convolution") {
            throw std::logic_error("In Age Gender network, age layer (" + ageOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->name +
                ") should be a Convolution, but was: " + ageOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->type);
        }

        if (genderOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->type != "SoftMax") {
            throw std::logic_error("In Age Gender network, gender layer (" + genderOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->name +
                ") should be a SoftMax, but was: " + genderOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->type);
        }
```

8. The names of the two output layers are logged and saved into variables used to retrieve results later.

```cpp
        slog::info << "Age layer: " << ageOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->name<< slog::endl;
        slog::info << "Gender layer: " << genderOutput->getCreatorLayer().lock()->name<< slog::endl;

        outputAge = ageOutput->name;
        outputGender = genderOutput->name;
```

9. Where the model will be loaded is logged, the model is marked as being enabled, and the InferenceEngine::CNNNetwork object containing the model is returned.

```cpp
        slog::info << "Loading Age Gender model to the "<< FLAGS_d_ag << " plugin" << slog::endl;
        _enabled = true;
        return netReader.getNetwork();
    }
};
```

# Using AgeGenderDetection

That takes care of specializing the BaseDetector class into the AgeGenderDetection class for the age and gender detection model.  We now move down into the main() function to see what additions have been made to use the age and gender detection model to process detected faces.

## main()

1. In the main() function, the command line arguments FLAGS_d_ag and FLAGS_m_ag are added to cmdOptions.  Remember that the flags are defined in the car_detection.hpp file.

```cpp
std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>> cmdOptions = {
   {FLAGS_d, FLAGS_m}, {FLAGS_d_ag, FLAGS_m_ag}
};
```

2. The age and gender detection object is instantiated.

```cpp
AgeGenderDetection AgeGender;
```

3. The model is loaded into the Inference Engine and associated with the device using the Load helper class previously covered.

```cpp
Load(AgeGender).into(pluginsForDevices[FLAGS_d_ag]);
```

## Main Loop

In the main "while(true)" loop, the inference results from the face detection model are used as input to the age and gender detection model.  

1. The loop to iterate through the fetched results is started.

```cpp
FaceDetection.fetchResults();
for (auto && face : FaceDetection.results) {
```

2. A check is made to see if the age and gender model is enabled.  If so, then get the ROI for the face by clipping the face location from the input image frame.

```cpp
   if (AgeGender.enabled()) {
      auto clippedRect = face.location & cv::Rect(0, 0, width, height);
      auto face = frame(clippedRect);
```

3. The face data is enqueued for processing.

```cpp
      if (AgeGender.enabled()) {
         AgeGender.enqueue(face);
      }
   }
}
```

4. The age and gender detection model is run to infer on the faces using submitRequest(), then the results are waited on using wait().  The submit-then-wait is enveloped with timing functions to measure how long the inference takes.

```cpp
t0 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
if (AgeGender.enabled()) {
   AgeGender.submitRequest();
   AgeGender.wait();
}
t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
ms secondDetection = std::chrono::duration_cast<ms>(t1 - t0);
```

5. The timing metrics for inference are output with the results for the age and gender inference added to the output window.

```cpp
if (AgeGender.enabled()) {
   out.str("");
   out << (AgeGender.enabled() ? "Age Gender"  : "")
       << "time: "<< std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << secondDetection.count()
       << " ms ";
   if (!FaceDetection.results.empty()) {
      out << "(" << 1000.f / secondDetection.count() << " fps)";
   }
   cv::putText(frame, out.str(), cv::Point2f(0, 65), cv::FONT_HERSHEY_TRIPLEX, 0.5, cv::Scalar(255, 0, 0));
}
```

6. The output image label is updated with the age and gender results for each detected face.  

```cpp
int i = 0;
for (auto & result : FaceDetection.results) {
   cv::Rect rect = result.location;
```

7. The decision is made to use a simple label or age and gender results if model enabled.

```cpp
   out.str("");
   if (AgeGender.enabled() && i < AgeGender.maxBatch) {
      out << (AgeGender[i].maleProb > 0.5 ? "M" : "F");
      out << std::fixed << std::setprecision(0) << "," << AgeGender[i].age;
   } else {
      out << (result.label < FaceDetection.labels.size() ? FaceDetection.labels[result.label] :
      std::string("label #") + std::to_string(result.label))
          << ": " << std::fixed << std::setprecision(3) << result.confidence;
   }
```

8. A label is placed on the output image for current result.

```cpp
  cv::putText(frame,
               out.str(),
               cv::Point2f(result.location.x, result.location.y - 15),
               cv::FONT_HERSHEY_COMPLEX_SMALL,
               0.8,
               cv::Scalar(0, 0, 255));
```

9. The color of the box around face is chosen based on the age and gender model’s confidence that the face is male.

```cpp
   auto genderColor =
         (AgeGender.enabled() && (i < AgeGender.maxBatch)) ?
            ((AgeGender[i].maleProb < 0.5) ? cv::Scalar(0, 0, 255) : cv::Scalar(255, 0, 0)) :
            cv::Scalar(0, 255, 0);
```

10. A rectangle is dranw around the face on the output image.

```   cv::rectangle(frame, result.location, genderColor, 2);
   i++;
}
```

11. Finally, the final results are displayed for the frame while measuring the time it took to show the image.

```cpp
t0 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
cv::imshow("Detection results", frame);
t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
ocv_render_time = std::chrono::duration_cast<ms>(t1 - t0).count();
```

## Post-Main Loop

The age and gender detection object is added to display the performance count information.

```cpp
if (FLAGS_pc) {
   FaceDetection.printPerformanceCounts();
   AgeGender.printPerformanceCounts();
}
```

# Building and Running

Now that we have walked through the added code and learned what it does, it is time to build the application and see it in action using two models to infer image information.

## Build

1. Open up a terminal (such as Xterm) or use an existing terminal to get to a command shell prompt.

2. Change to the directory containing Tutorial Step 3:

```bash
cd tutorials/face_detection_tutorial/step_3
```

3. The first step is to configure the build environment for the OpenVINO™ toolkit by running the "setupvars.sh" script.

```bash
source  /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh
```

4. Now we need to create a directory to build the tutorial in and change to it.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

5. The last thing we need to do before compiling is to configure the build settings and build the executable. We do this by running CMake to set the build target and file locations. Then we run Make to build the executable.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
make
```

## Run

1. Before running, be sure to source the helper script that will make it easier to use environment variables instead of long names to the models:

```bash
source ../../scripts/setupenv.sh 
```

2. You now have the executable file to run ./intel64/Release/face_detection_tutorial. In order to load the age and gender detection model, the "-m_ag" flag needs to be added  followed by the full path to the model. First let us see how it works on a single image file:

```bash
./intel64/Release/face_detection_tutorial -m $mFDA32 -m_ag $mAG32 -i ../../data/face.jpg
```

3. The output window will show the image overlaid with colored rectangles over each of the detected faces with labels showing the age and gender results. The timing statistics for computing the results of each model along with OpenCV input and output times are also shown.  Next, let us try it on a video file.

```bash
./intel64/Release/face_detection_tutorial -m $mFDA32 -m_ag $mAG32 -i /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/openvx/samples/samples/face_detection/face.mp4
```

4. You will see rectangles that follow the faces around the image (if the faces move), accompanied by age and gender results for the faces, and the timing statistics for processing each frame of the video. Finally, let us see how it works for camera input.

```bash
./intel64/Release/face_detection_tutorial -m $mFDA32 -m_ag $mAG32 -i cam
```

Or

```bash
./intel64/Release/face_detection_tutorial -m $mFDA32 -m_ag $mAG32
```

5. Again, you will see colored rectangles drawn around any faces that appear in the images, along with the results for age, gender, and the various render statistics.

# Conclusion

Building on the single model application from Tutorial Step 2, this step has shown that using a second inference model in an application is just as easy as using the first. This also shows how powerful your applications can become by using one model to analyze the results you obtain from another model. This is the power the OpenVINO™ toolkit brings to applications. Continuing to Tutorial Step 4, we will expand the application once more by adding another model to estimate head pose based on the same face data that we used in Tutorial Step 3 to estimate age and gender.
